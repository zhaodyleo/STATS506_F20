### Part 1 (dplyr)

In the part 1 of the activity you will write or interpret short dplyr pipes
that explore or analyze the `Orange` data from R's `datasets` package. The data
which contains 35 rows and 3 columns recording the growth
of orange trees.  The three columns in the data set are:

  - `Tree`: an ordered factor, identifying individual trees, 
  - `age`: a numeric vector giving the number of days 
    since the tree was planted,
  - `circumference`: a numeric vector recording the circumference of the 
    trunk in mm. 

You can read more at `?Orange`. 

1. Write a dplyr pipe to determine the number of
observations per tree.

```{r q1}
Orange %>% count(Tree)
```

2. Write a dplyr pipe to change the units of age to "years" 
and circumference to "cm".

```{r q2}
Orange_y_cm = Orange %>%
                transmute(
                  Tree = Tree,
                  age = age/365,
                  circumference = circumference/1000)
```

 
3. Write a dplyr pipe to add a column assigning a
z-score to each tree, centered around the mean for all trees at a given age.

```{r q3}
Orange_y_cm %>%
  mutate(z_score=z_score1(age))
```

 
4. Write a dplyr pipe to calculate the average rate of growth
(cm/year) across all trees between between age 0 (assume circumference = 0) and
the final measured age for each tree.

```{r q4}
Orange_y_cm %>% 
  group_by(Tree) %>%
  transmute(
    average_rate = max(circumference)/max(age)
  ) %>% 
  unique()
```

5. Describe the result of the following pipe in 1-3 sentences. Your
    *description* should touch on both the rows and columns and also describe
    a substantive question addressed by the result. 

```r
 Orange %>%
   group_by(Tree) %>%
   mutate( 
     new_growth = c(circumference[1], diff(circumference)),
     elapsed = c(age[1], diff(age))
   ) %>%
   group_by(age) %>% 
   summarize( 
     avg_rate = mean(new_growth / elapsed),
     se = sd( new_growth / elapsed ) / sqrt(n()) 
   )
```

**Description:**

This code computes the average rate of growth across different trees in the same age.
